# This Makefile offers convience shortcuts into any Node.js project that utilizes npm scripts.
# It functions as a wrapper around the actual listed in `package.json`
# So instead of typing:
#
#  $ npm script build:assets
#
# you could just as well type:
#
#  $ make build-assets
#
# Notice that colons (:) are replaced by dashes (-) for Makefile compatibility.
#
# The benefits of this wrapper are that:
#
# - You get to keep the the scripts package.json, which is more portable
#   (Makefiles aren't Windows friendly)
# - Offer a polite way into the project for developers coming from Unix/C-type environments
#   (npm scripts is obviously very Node centric)
# - Profit from better autocomplete (make <TAB><TAB>) than npm currently offers.
#   (OSX users will have to install bash-completion http://davidalger.com/development/bash-completion-on-os-x-with-brew/)
# - You won't have to duplicate logic, this Makefile automatically reflects the latest scripts that package.json has to offer
